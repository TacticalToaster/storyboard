## What is Storyboard?
Storyboard is an updated and maintained roleplay framework for the game Garry's Mod. Storyboard was based off of the now deprecated [Clockwork](https://github.com/cloudsixteen/Clockwork). Storyboard is entirely open source and still in pretty early stages of development as of now so use is not recommended.
